That wasn't that useful, just basic, and I don't have another thing.

Hey, guys.
I'm back, with a new tinkering device! 
(Samsung Galaxy A2 Core, Dark Grey, 8GB storage, expandable by SD card,
1GB RAM, running on a reflashed INS firmware, of Android 8.1.0 - Oreo Go Edition.)

And by the way, I had to reflash, because the phone was from Thailand, and would default back to Thai on reset, 
and also, the THL firmware it originally had, was region-locked, and had way more bloat than the INS version. 

Anyway, enough background. Let's get tinkering with an Android device!

So, yeah, here's the stuff I managed to play with off-scene:


Unlocked the bootloader, after flashing the INS firmware.

Installed Termux.

Compiled Lua 5.4.6 from source, after installing normally failed, like, 5 times.

Currently prototyping a "Call Lua from WebKit" thing, haven't tested.


Sorry I haven't updated this, lol. 'Member how I was talking about hacking a M8 Game Stick? Nope. Even though it runs U-Boot and a stripped down Linux 3.x/4.x kernel, there's no way to get a shell, so nah. So, final plan: Buy a remote for that Fire Stick, get ADB running, and do my research. You will see scripts published here soon, lol, so check that out.

(Kamikiri failed, fought with FireISO and installing Kamikiri for 2 and a half hours, it failed, lol.)

So, gonna work with primarily older Android devices (KitKat to Pie), and see how that goes. Maybe work with Red Velvet Cake in the future, lol, when I get a Pixel XL (when I get a stable job and cash.)

Bye for now, FreeBSDKernel9-0.

Oh, hey. So, update, getting a Fire Stick remote tomorrow, so I don't have to buy one. But, anyway, I'm working on ideas, but I don't have any yet, since I don't 
have file paths and shit, but when I get into the file paths, and other stuff, like API's (for custom pop-up's, notifications, yada, yada, yada), I will FINALLY
start making scripts. Also, I said this in my old repo, but I need to add a thing. 

I will have seperate folders, with guides for where to go and stuff, so that's cool. But yeah, folders, with my scripts.
They will be MKSH, though (sorry, Linux bros!), because I only know Debian Bash, and plus, I primarily tinker with Android stuff, so yeah, cool.

Anyway, see ya,
FreeBSDKernel9-0.

So that last C thing was too basic, so I'm not even gonna bother writing C. I'd rather read and explain C, like what Low Level does, since I can read most languages, including C, just not write them.
But yeah, got a remote, which paired first try, but no WiFi on it (entirely my fault).

But yeah, the person that gave me the remote said they'll give me a new Fire Stick if mine doesn't work, so my thing (I didn't announce the name previously) Operation: Dumb ADB Tomfoolery isn't dead. But anyway, lemme explain what happened: 

I cracked the WiFi/Bluetooth chip (MediaTek 67739 BSN) when pulling the shield off without heat, in the top-left corner, so yeah, amazing.
That's why the remote paired first try, but the WiFi kept dropping. So, that's fun, I guess.

Anyway, I'm out,
FreeBSDKernel9-0.

So yeah, update, that stick died. I was messing around and found a set of pins about a millimeter apart from the CPU (I've no clue, MediaTek ARM something something?) arranged in a colon pattern, and they were CLK and DAT. So I then found out by shorting DAT with the end of a paperclip, the whole stick reboots. Thought that was cool, and kept doing it, then realized I scraped the pin off the board, and when I tried to turn it on again, it wouldn't boot. 

But yeah, cracked WiFi chip anyway, so it was a brick, anyway. That's kinda annoying, since it might've been hackable with Kamikiri, considering how long it wasn't updated for. Welp, never mind. Anyway, posted my first release, ro-debuggable.sh . And you'll see this repo get wayyy more releases than some of my others, since MKSH is a language I reliably know (still learnng, but it's pretty simple) so I don't need to wait for devs, I can just do it myself.

Anyway, bye,
FreeBSDKernel9-0.

So, hey guys. Got that Fire Stick.

Here's the specs:

Fire TV Stick 2nd Gen (internally code named 'tank')

Firmare version: Fire OS 5.2.9.5

Build ID: LVY48F

What it's based on: Android Lollipop (5.1.1)

Made in: Luxembourg

Assembled in: China

Model No: LY73PR

And spoilers, I already found a wide-open Privilege Leak.

Later, 
FreeBSDKernel9-0.

Oh, hey. So, I'm back from doing a release real quick. So anyway, lemme explain this Privilege Leak I found.
It's a classic Privilege Leak on the flag for core_dump_debug_enable (which was set to [n], before I exploited this Leak), that allows you to just... kinda enable that debug flag. When testing, I used it to get a bugreport.txt fle from when I crashed Amazon's custom boot init, neo-init.
For context, before that flag was enabled, I couldn't get one, because the data/tombstones directory required (root) access, and trying to get a Bug Report 
from the shell would just throw an error.

Oh, also got Silk's version string: Chromium Blink 108.0.5359.220. This probably has some vulnerabilities, but:

(1) Not a web developer.
(2) I have literally zero experience in exploiting V8 CVE's, I'd shout out @nt-fargo for that, lol. (The 'CSSFontFace Use-After-Free in WebKit' guy.)

Anyway, later,
FreeBSDKernel9-0.

Holy mother of- Yo, it's literally been a few hours since I discovered the core_dump_debug_enable vulnerability, and I just got, like, WAAY more.


Improper Access Control (CWE 284) In The SQLite3 Tables, Allowing For Full SQLite3 Read/Write Access
Information Disclosure (CWE 200) And Incorrect Permission Assignment (CWE 276) Aiding In Gaining Full SQLite3 Read/Write Access
Missing Authorization (CWE 862) And Improper Handling Of System Disruptions (CWE 755) Aiding To DoS The DREAMING_STATE Screensaver


So, as you can tell, I've been pretty busy today, huh?



Oh, hello again. Posted my core_dump_debug_enable Privilege Leak script, and just from that, I got a few extra:

External Control Of System Configuration Setting (CWE 15) In The Property Flags, To Aid In A Privilege Leak Chain
Improper Privilege Management (CWE 269) To Gain Unauthorized Access To (root) Property Flags
Externally Controlled Reference To A Resource In Another Sphere (CWE 610) To Trigger A (root) Property Flag While In UID 2000 (shell).

Bye for now, 
FreeBSDKernel9-0.

Well, turns out DoS'ing the screensaver once worked, but it now doesn't, so here's two new apps (Netflix/YouTube) that use these same vulnerabilities to crash:

Using CWE 755 (Improper Handling Of System Disruptions), and CWE 862 (Missing Authorization) to panick the Android System Server, and throw a NULL Focused App
dump. (Updated BrokenAccessControlChain.sh to accomodate.)

Anyway, bye,
FreeBSDKernel9-0.

So, update, found yet another vulnerability. Jeez, it's been, like, 3 days! 
Now, the script I released to trigger it is compltely broken, but it's just supposed to show how it works, anyway.

Now, the vulnerability. It's a vulnerability in the 'WiFi Password' field in the Settings app, where, by inserting special characters after you've reached the
character limit, you can cause an App Crash.

At it's core, it's an Input Sanitization Flaw, Leading To a Buffer Overflow, and App Crash.

What it leverages: 

CWE 20 (Improper Input Validation)
CWE 1284 (Improer Validation Of Specifed Quality In Input)
CWE 120 (Buffer Copy Without Checking The Size Of Input)
CWE 787 (Out Of Bounds Write)

How to trigger it (manually): 

Launch Settings (either with shell commands, or by just going to the Settings icon, and hitting Network)

Go to a WiFi network that isn't connected (or just disconnect yours)

Click it

When it asks for a Password, type 'A' a bunch, until you can't type any more characters.

Then immediately start spamming the $ sign (It's a special character, which triggers the Buffer Overflow)

Instead of stripping them out lie a secure app, it will keep letting you type them

When you feel like it, immediately start spamming the " symbol

Same as earlier, but spam the & symbol

Then spam more $ symbols (This triggers the crash)

Hit 'Submit' like normal

If lucky: It will freeze for a few seconds, then kick you to the Home Screen (or sometimes yank you back into your last app)
If not: Instead of displaying 'Invalid Password', it will freeze, then show a message saying 'An unexpected error has occurred.'

Later,
FreeBSDKernel9-0.
